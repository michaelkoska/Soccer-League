# Soccer-League
This is a website for a city soccer league. Players can sign up and add themselves to a team or be listed as a free agent (where the league commissioner will add them onto an open team or a captain can send a request). Only captains can create a team and only one captain per team. Anyone can be a captain, but captains will be responsible for team dues. There will also be a league schedule the commissioner can input. This app will be able to be used for multiple soccer seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter). All payments for the league will be registered through PayPal.

There are many more things to be done, but these are the major next steps.
